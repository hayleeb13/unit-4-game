# unit-4-game

* The purpose of the project is to create a number game.
* The screen first displays a random number and four crystals each with a different number.
* The user starts by clicking on the crystals and attempts to add up the user score to make it equal to the random number.
* If the user matches their number to the random number, the wins category goes up.
* If the user passes the random number, the losses category goes up.

* The project allows the user to interact with the program.

* The user can get started by clicking on any of the four gems.
